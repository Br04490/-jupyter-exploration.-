This is for Jupyter-exploration and practice
This repository was created as part of Week 1 of the course to explore GitHub and understand version control fundamentals. During this lab session, I set up my GitHub account, navigated the dashboard, and learned about repositories, issues, and pull requests.

The purpose of this repository is to practice creating a project, initializing it with a README file, and making my first commit directly to the main branch. This serves as an introduction to managing code and documentation using GitHub.
